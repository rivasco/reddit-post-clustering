Cancun would be an easier option but Cancun in March sounds like a lot of drunk college students to me.

We re looking for something that s Super chill not into big crowds or high-adrenaline activities no paragliding for us . Walk-able and relaxing we love the idea of morning beach walks, casual hikes, or exploring small towns shops. Good food not exclusively seafood, but we re definitely food people. English-friendly we don t mind being international we're in California , but some English spoken would help. Affordable doesn t need to be dirt cheap, but not luxury pricing either. Low driving stress we don t want to spend a ton of time in the car, especially not on the left side of the road. We ve been to Hawaii twice , so we d like something a bit different this time. Currently considering the US Virgin Islands love the idea of beaches hiking lounging , but we re open to other ideas. Countryside or mountain destinations could also work if they hit the same chill vibe.

Thank you all so much for taking the time to share your input Hi everyone Looking for some recommendations for US vacation spots for a four-day trip in late October. Budget is 1000 total. Details about us F33 with partner M37 Traveling from MI. Flying or driving works. Both in good shape and physically capable. Not interested in traveling out West I can elaborate more on that below . We enjoy spending time outdoors, history historic landmarks, science, art, museums, comedy, and music. New to golf and totally obsessed- We re terrible though haha. I have been sober for 3 years woohoo so we typically avoid wineries or breweries. Any feedback is greatly appreciated. I m hoping to be able to pull something together as a surprise for him. Unnecessary background for the request itself but for those who want the tea We had a whole 10-day trip to Europe mapped out. It was set to be our first big trip together in duration and experience . We were both pretty excited. We had a vacation budget set aside and it just lined up really well where we could take advantage of Delta deals, sky miles, and some unused flight credits from previous work trips. Unfortunately, we just hit some bad luck with our vehicles and had two unexpected and pricey car issues, that put us in a less than ideal financial spot. Wanting to be responsible we decided it would be smarter to cancel our big trip until we can get our emergency funds back where they were previously. The problem is I know he was really looking forward to the trip. Work has been really stressful and I think just having a little time away and something to look forward to was really nice. Of course, I was also looking forward to the trip. But this post is about him, not me. SOOO. I m trying to surprise him with something still. Obviously not as grandiose as Edinburgh or golfing in Scotland, but just a fun new experience. We have travelled to Arizona, hocking hills, Chicago, Detroit, and the upper peninsula of MI. Not opposed to any of those spots again- but hoping for something new. I have no hate for the West haha. However, he has been putting money away for a long time to take his daughter on a big trip out West in the spring, as a way to celebrate her high-school graduation. I want that memory and experience to be all their own, so I don t want the two of us to travel there beforehand.

I'm a little sad because it's something I wanted to do for a while, but I really don't want to go and have the baby and us be miserable outside. Our trips are usually not super packed with activities, we like to relax but also like to explore and always do hikes and aurora borealis tours when we go to that type of place. I know we have time, but I want to make sure I have time to plan for a nice trip as I know our lives will get way busier with the baby. We live in Boston and have no family here.

We're having trouble coming up with ideas for a trip this year. Here are thoughts that we've discussed We aren't opposed to a tropical vacation, but looking for something different than a resort. We thought about New York City, but was concerned about the weather and travel hassles. We wouldn't mind traveling to Europe England Germany are high on the list , but concerned about cold rainy weather. We're also OK with going somewhere in the USA, assuming that the weather is decent. We've done Vegas and many other locales in the USA, so maybe something off the beaten path, that has some good activities to do around Christmas. We're somewhat budget-conscious for this trip, as we already did a 2 week trip to Japan and China earlier this year that was pretty expensive.

Space coast would be cool too Ideally I'm looking for a Secrets Resort and Spa in FL but obviously without the all-inclusive part because that doesn't exist in the USA.", "author": "user_61712", "created": "2025-08-07 12:19:34+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1mjyjjm/quiet_hotel_pool_in_fl/", "keywords": "-,12pm,50th,all-inclusive,almost,anything,anywhere,area,back,bad.", "images": []}
{"id": "1mj6n7d", "title": "Having trouble deciding where to go", "body": "Hey all, I 28m have been working a new job and finally have money to actually think about taking vacations and such. Before this, we myself, wife 26f, mother 47f, and sister 18f always took the time to go to a comic con once a year, being into anime and such, but I'd like to plan an actual big vacation for us. Since none of us have ever been, I'm thinking Disneyland, Disney World, or Universal Studios. Problem is of course that I'm not sure which would be best. Price isn't a concern, since I'll be throwing a good amount of money aside for this, it's more about attractions themselves. We won't be worried that much about roller coasters, since my mother gets sick on them real easily, so it's more about what will represent our interests better. Disney movies were big for all of us of course, my mother and wife enjoy marvel movies and Pirates of the Caribbean, and we're all Harry Potter fans as well. Just trying to figure out what would give us the best experience for our first big vacation. From online searching, I understand that DisneyWorld is much bigger than Disneyland, though Disneyland appears to be better maintained, cleaner, and have more care put into things, both due to small size and being the original park. Speaking of parks, each one apparently has multiple parks you have to have separate tickets for, further complicating the matter I'd just really enjoy some input from more experienced people, especially anyone who has been to the parks before.", "author": "user_7492", "created": "2025-08-06 14:47:08+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1mj6n7d/having_trouble_deciding_where_to_go/", "keywords": "18f,26f,,28m,47f,,actual,actually,all,,always,amount,anime", "images": []}

Everything looked great and clean until a family member sat down on the bed and saw roaches scattering to the top. It was absolutely disgusting. I've had my fair share of good and bad airbnbs and I can say that majority were on the bad side. We all viewed airbnb with a great opportunity to stay somewhere like being in the comfort of your own home, but now I feel more on guard and grossed out each time I use airbnb like using a public restroom at a gas station. Anyways..I demanded a full refund as there were roaches and you can see how the host was trying to bribe me into not leaving a bad review in order to receive my full refund. Very shady. I just stuck to my demand of a full refund and kept the conversation short because I definitely intended to leave a review, as this is a health hazard. Well a few days later after receiving the refund, the option to leave a review for the trip was removed. I contacted airbnb and they said I can't leave a review because the trip was cancelled. I had another reservation within the same trip to Floroda that got cancelled and yet I was still given the option to review the stay. How weird ... The listing is still up and active. Even after the numerous attempts of contacting airbnb to report this issue. Another previous stay through airbnb, there was a weed growing in the house with overgrown weeds surrounding it with a giant hole within the vent near the crawl space. This is an obvious invitation for pests. I was only given a partial refund. A lot of times with other stays, I've been shorted on towels, toilet paper, sponges, shower products, etc. And yet they expect you to clean when they don't provide you with what is necessary. Cheap stuff to use as well. Like all in one shower shampoo body wash, watered down conditioner, etc. The floors are always filthy with my reservations and I always wear socks or slippers. I can go on and on about what airbnb is lacking and I'll lay it out flat now. The hosts don't use professional services that are necessary, such as pest control, cleaning services, etc. Instead, they try and take the role on themselves. It's disgusting.

It has happened, but with small business hotels. It never happens with a good big name brand, like a marriot or hyatt. I've heard some good things about vrbo, too.

Check cabinets and drawers for silverfish etc. Always look under sinks, toilets, appliances fridges, range, dryer, washing machine . This is where cockroaches thrive. All pests seek food, water, and shelter. I've seen other posts similar for airbnb stays and seen locals say it is normal and typical for florida to have those pests. That is a lame excuse.

We live in NE Ohio so there's a few within relatively easy driving distance from us, and that was an enabler. I took particular liking to the gravesites. Like 15 years go by and I look back to document my travels to realize I had seen about half the presidents already. I was like how can I see the other half. So each year I had been making a trip to go to a different geographic area of the US and take some in. Like 2021 I did a SW Ohio, and Kentucky weekend road trip. 2022 I did a long weekend trip of New England. 2023 I did like a week long mid Atlantic road trip, and 2024 I visited the LA area, as well as a long weekend in Kansas city. I would usually pair these trips timing wise with something going on in the area like a concert, or event. Entering this past fall November 2024 I only had 7 left to visit, and planning this these trips out years in advance was getting exhausting and I wanted to move on. So I had the idea of the endgame trip lets finish them all and I can get on with my life. So that's what I'm doing. For 8 days seeing Iowa, Tennessee, Central Texas, and Western Michigan. So I booked it, and here's the rough itinerary. I say rough as I actually have every action I take broken out into 15 increments for the day on a spreadsheet but you don't need all that haha. I'm also doing all this by myself. Day 1- Fly into Cedar Rapids Iowa, rent car, explore mount trashmore, go to Herbert Hoover's grave the museum is unfortunately closed for renovations right now , explore university of Iowa Day 2 fly into Tri City airport in TN, rent car drive to Greeneville TN and explore the Andrew Johnson sites. Drive from there to Nashville maybe making a pitstop at Bucee's, drop off car at the airport and take bus to airbnb. Day 3 Walk around Nashville, find James Polk's gravesite, take a bus to The Hermitage to see Andrew Jackson's. Take a bus back and then check out some country music sites not necessarily really into country but when in Rome... trying to figure out where between country music hof, johnny cash museum, and ryman auditorium. and find some time to get some chicken in there. Then check out broadway at night. Day 4 Walk around nashville some more. Check out vanderbilt, and centennial park, go to third man records. Make up day kinda day. Day 5 take a bus to airport and fly to Austin TX. Rent Car, drive to LBJ Library. Explore that and univ of Texas. Go to hotel walk around s. congress area Day 6 Drive to check out the food truck park, and the barton springs pool. Then drive from here to Johnson City, and Stonewall TX to take in the LBJ sites. From there driving to San Antonio for the evening to explore sites like the riverwalk, the alamo and more, then drive back maybe making another stop at Bucee's haha. Day 7 Drive to Texas A M to check out the library and grave of George HW Bush. Explore the university for a bit then drive back to Austin, and take in whatever I can. Day 8 Drive to airport and fly to Grand Rapids MI. Quickly take in Gerald Ford Museum, and then take the greyhound back home. I have a long layover in Chicago so will wander around there for a bit too. Day 9 return home. So by the end of it all I would have seen 7 president's and quite a few cultural institutions. Definitely taking suggestions though. Now Jimmy Carter did pass away after I already booked this trip but I may have the opportunity to see those sites later in the year.

We think the whole family would benefit from a change of pace They spend around 5k on the Airbnb itself for 7 days more on food idk how much . We also usually a do a sunset boat cruise, so whatever that costs. My guess is around 7-8k total for the 6 of us. We could do a lot more in depth travel for that much like cruises, even Europe probably, but his brother is severely allergic to almost everything and must have access to a kitchen. We bring his own separate microwave on this vacation bc he can t even share with us. Because of this, we re trying to figure out a vacation for a similar price that we could get an Airbnb or a hotel with a kitchen in an area with a lot to do The shore town we go to now is boring you can only do the fun stuff there so many times before you re not even looking forward to it anymore. Flying is okay, but we d have to take into account multiple checked bags bc of his brothers medical stuff possible food we d need to bring along if there s no grocery store nearby.

This will take a bit of prep work to keep the cats comfortable and definitely some renting. Shots and visas and passports and all that are no issue I m ready , but the nitty gritty of getting there in style are my main concern with this post. I d love to hear from people who ve been to these places, to know what sort of options are available for buying cat litter and renting vehicles. I m open to shipping materials to a pickup box in each country and I ll probably just have a travel agent arrange all this , but it s always good to ask for local opinions and easy routes before committing. I d rather not get fleeced by a local agency if I can just stop by a shopping mart and nail the prep in minutes.

My partner did express they wanted to Gamble a little which I don't agree with but I'm cool as long as it's their money and I'd love to visit this one park that was near my great grandparents house I dream about it a lot and show my partner where I grew up. Japan I've wanted to go to Japan since I was a six year old watching Sailor Moon dvds and playing with my Tokyo Bratz dolls, love the culture and want to visit Shinto Shrines and bamboo forest and also the fun things to do there that are like Vegas Arcade games and Museums. I've always wanted to visit a Summer Festival. My partner also loves anime as well and loves Ramen. My partner also is not vegetarian or vegan like myself and loves sushi I do too just the vegans ones lol I also love things like miso soup, Taiyakis those pancakes with sweet sugar beans Would love to check out the thrift stores there. South Korea Is less expensive than Japan, I'd love to wear a Hanbok and go to the palace place or temple. Looks to be way less over stimulating than Japan. I can handle the over stimulation of Vegas because I was born there so the lights and coin machines feels like home, I'd love to try there street food a some of it looks vegetarian at the least. My partner and I plan on having at least one child within this time and South Korea has play Cafe places that look amazing. And yet again I'd love to go to thrift stores to go shopping. I also love the way I see tattoos done in South Korea and would love to get a tattoo in South Korea or its just the shop I've seen online in South Korea if SK doesn't have a specific style of the few tattoos that they do.

It all begins last summer when we've planned this trip originally but it failed due to some bullshit excuses this person provided me with. I thought they just simply didn't wanna go, but then a couple months later they get back to me saying that we should plan the trip cuz now they have free time. This person has nearly 0 for their travelling budget but I was okay with going on a cheaper trip. But if you wanna have a tight budget u need to plan ahead right According to this person, not at all. They were completely uninterested in helping me find accommodation, repeatedly sayin that it's a waste of time to look at a million Airbnbs the whole process took less than 2 hours . They were playing videogames the whole time I was looking for apartments... I got over it, but when they showed complete disinterest in finding the things we wanna see I started to get a bit annoyed. Because of the budget we only have 3 and a half days here not enough time to see the whole city btw . So I thought maybe if we have a good schedule planned out we can manage speedruning it. What do they say to this We should plan a day trip to another city. Like excuse me I wanna see that too, but because of ur budget we already don't have enough time to see our original destination. They keep saying that this day trip is one of the main reasons they decided to come with BUT they didn't even bother checking how we can get there via public transportation and how much it would cost. We can plan it the night before, after seeing how things go in the main city . I repeatedly asked them to check things ahead of time as it is February and maybe not all touristy destinations are easily approachable at this time of year. I got ignored again and again and again. I went to their home town a couple days before the main trip and we had a bunch of things planed cuz I wanted to do some sightseeing. This person got up after 2pm each day, taking their sweet time to get ready, we didn't do half the things we had planned. Again, I got annoyed but got over it, I voiced my concerns, but they were met with deaf ears. Everything I say is imminently dismissed by them they have travelled a total of 1 time to a foreign country without their parents and it was a neighboring country . They have little to no flight experience, and travel experience overall. I don't judge them bc of it, but for the love of God listen to the more experienced person if they say something. Today we get here everything goes okay, but they are constantly whining, about prices, their back, head, leg etc. We get back to the apartment and first thing I hear about is that goddamn daytrip. I was like, bruh if ur whining because of walking around the city you won't shut up if we go on a 5-10 mile hike in February just to see some churches and ruins and what not. Not to mention they still haven't planned the trip. I flip out after they tell me for the millionth time that this will be different, they will wake up early, they won't whine etc. When this is like the 100th empty promise they made this week. Idk what to do, I don't wanna fight the whole trip. But I told them, if I wanna travel with a child I bring my brother with me. I thought I was traveling with an adult. Am I the ahole tho for making it worse by yelling at them after all this.

We all know that traveling as a family gets ridiculously expensive flights, multiple rooms, peak season pricing, and all the little extras add up fast. If you splurge on over-the-top, bucket-list trips or just enjoy a good luxury all-inclusive that also keeps the kids happy, this is the place to swap ideas, share wins, and get real about what actually works. So if you ve figured out how to make luxury travel work for your family whether it s a well laid out suite, a next-level resort that made traveling with kids feel easy, or even a high-end adventure that was totally worth the splurge share your wisdom Because let s be honest traveling with kids is a circus.

I asked him and he said he wants beach vacay . So, we are thinking clear calm waters. Caribbean or Bahamas. I'm so overwhelmed with the choices. I'm trying to narrow it to a certain island, but it's a challenge. Can you help Here are some guidelines and history to help. first and foremost, my husband is newish Celiac disease. Food is a BIG deal in terms of quality and safety. He's generally a steak and potato kind of guy, so dinner isn't usually too much of an issue. Breakfast and lunch are more of a challenge - think burgers, pizza, pancakes...all the things that have to really be swapped out. Because of this, I was drawn to Sandal's resorts due to the amount of reviews concerning celiac safety. However, I'm not locked into that brand. really want to go for an all inclusive resort. Budget range 6000-8000ishfor 5-7 nights, flights not included. he enjoys golf, but prob only play if friends go with us not likely , and casino is a plus haha we would probably mostly stay at resort. We like to do Catamaran, but overall not looking to take lots of excursions or anything. We want to just be together. we have been to Aruba twice, so looking to try somewhere new. Loved Aruba though we have been to Hard Rock Punta Cana back in 2014, it was a great trip and our first resort. We loved that resort had so many pools and restaurants. Not wanting to go to Mexico. Been to a few places there and cruised there. We have never been to Bahamas, Virgin Islands, or other Caribbean places besides what I listed. Places that caught our eye Butler Level at Sandals La Toc, Sandals St. Vincent, Sandals Royal Caribbean like I said...Sandals kick. St. Lucia resorts La Ladera - I worry about the bugs.... If my husband had a weird super power or was a super hero...it would involve BUGS. They SWARM to him. It's the weirdest thing. Inside or outside they find him, but totally avoid me. He has had the most random run-in's with spiders, wasps, mosquitos, etc. I joke about it, but it really is bad So I worry about going somewhere that's too tropical like rainforesty because of that. any suggestions or personal experiences would be appreciated", "author": "user_6128", "created": "2025-01-28 02:43:18+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1ibrkqs/tropicalbeach_vacay_for_husbands_40th_celiac/", "keywords": ",,-,.,2014,,2026,40th,5-7,6000-8000ishfor,adults,amount", "images": []}

You can compare the exact pricing per night directly at this website and see the deal this gives you I can transfer one or both certificates to whoever would like to purchase these. IMPORTANT These are about to expire however, you have until March 15th to travel. Check out date MUST be no later than March 15th but you can travel for 5 days anytime between now and March 15th, 2025. You also do NOT need to go to Le Blanc or even Los Cabos.

Fortunately for us they love the adventure, and they are always ready to jump in the car for a long road trip. My pick for our next trip in the Spring is Toronto, CA. I personally love the place because of Degrassi, but I've never been. Minus the day we get in town and lease, we are having a 4 day trip - I think this is enough for a nice visit. Day one is assigned to the Niagara Falls, but I do not know if the visit will take the whole day, I am thinking maybe half a day Let me know if I am wrong. Also, when I started my research I noticed there's a US side and a CA side Which side is better to visit the Falls from and that the Falls is within a State Park on the US side at this point in my search it looks like the view is better from the CA side. am I wrong Day two is assigned to Toronto - in my list I currently have CN Tower - that seems like a must for the kids, the St. Lawrence Market because we are foodies. I am very excited about this one And then the Nathan Phillips Square, which I believe to be in downtown Toronto. Are there must see places to add to this list for someone driving almost 10 hours. No aquariums, museums, the kids are over that, and so am I. I was excited when I came across the Canadian National Exhibition, but we are out of luck, since it only take place in Aug and Sept. Day three - still up for discussion is Buffalo NY - which I am open to swap with any other nice CA town to visit. Day four - and this is the main purpose of this post - I need help identifying the best scenic roads highways to drive through - My husband loves to drive, and must of all he loves to drive thru beautiful places, so I want to dedicate this day to him. I tried to research this, but I am not satisfied. We do not mind driving 2-3hrs out of Toronto staying in CA , for a total 4-6hrs round trip - I think that's not bad and it will be worth it hopefully . Also, if there are local places we can stop to eat, that would be great Looking forward to your comments, and thank you in advance for your help", "author": "user_70997", "created": "2025-01-12 03:12:08+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1hzdegb/going_to_toronto_and_need_help/", "keywords": ",,-,.,10,11,13.,2-3hrs,4,4-6hrs,across", "images": []}

I am set to be done with school in May, and at that time our kid will be about 6-7 months old. My husband did not take any vacation time this year because he wanted to save it all for paternity leave, but that doesn't mean he's getting any kind of vacation when our baby gets here. On top of this, my husband's job is super stressful, and I would like to go on a vacation with him and our infant in May before I have to go back to work, because he has been working so hard, he deserves a good break where he can have some fun, I'm just stumped as to what we can do. To add to the complexity, he never got to really go on vacations as a kid because his mom was a single mother, and so he either has really strict no's, or he doesn't know if he will enjoy himself while on vacation. He has terrible allergies, so while he likes to go hiking, he doesn't like to hike where there are things growing, bc he's allergic to everything that grows. He spends a lot of his free time playing video games. He hates the heat and the beach. He loves the cold and snow. He loved the Royal Caribbean cruise to Cococ cay we went on, he liked jetskiing, he loved Universal Studios, but hated Disney understandable . He does not ride on rollercoasters or even track rides that move a lot due to getting stuck upside down one time and motion sickness. He hates Canada I'm sorry, Canada, it's not you, it's Trudeau . And he does not want to take the kid on a plane for a super long period of time, so overseas travel is a no-go. He loves a good scotch, or will have a couple fruity cocktails, but will absolutely not drink and drive. Do you have any ideas for a vacation where he could enjoy himself that might meet this ridiculous criteria Our budget is about 10k. Thank you so much in advance for any help or insight you can provide", "author": "user_67992", "created": "2024-09-17 22:27:01+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1fjcw3q/vacation_suggestion_request/", "keywords": ".,10k.,6-7,8,absolutely,add,advance,allergic,allergies,,baby", "images": []}

{"id": "1dgfmyi", "title": "Visa rejections have led MakeMyTrip to offer ticket cancellations if visa is rejected", "body": "A consumer didn't get a refund from MakeMyTrip for a vacation package to Greece. Despite many issues about visa delays, the user paid in installments and submitted visa documents verified by the trip agency. When the visa did not approach, he instantly asked for a refund but faced issues. Numerous others also participated in similar experiences with visa-related cancellations and non-refundable bookings for flights and hotels. To address this, MakeMyTrip introduced a new insurance policy called visa guarantee. This ensures a full refund of flight fare if a client's traveler visa is rejected by the embassy. This insurance is offered by a third party and covers regular and e-visas but not visas on arrival. A formal rejection letter must be presented to claim the refund. The cost of this add-on insurance varies, ranging from a few hundred to several thousand rupees, depending on the destination. MakeMyTrip's co-founder and CEO, stressed that India is one of the swift-growing tourism requests. He noted that foreign tourism boards are trying to attract Indian tourists with encouragement campaigns and simplified visa conditions. Still, visa rejections remain a significant issue. In its recent results, MakeMyTrip reported a profit of 202.9 million, up 36.6 from the former time, driven by high journey demand in India. The airline business grew by 33 time, while domestic marking saw a slight 5 times enhancement. The company maintains a request share of over 30 times in domestic air marking, despite some reduction in departures due to general choices and high airfares. Expersts mentioned that domestic air supply would gradually enhance in the alternate half of the current financial time. Despite issues like predicated flights and strikes, airlines like IndiGo, Air India, and SpiceJet are expanding and replacing airplanes. The long-term outlook for the Indian flight sector remains strong, with increased aeronautics structure and new airplanes. In the hospitality sector, MakeMyTrip saw a 41 time growth in perimeters. Global and original hostel chains are expanding in India, especially in lower metropolises. MakeMyTrip now has over 84,000 properties on its platform. The Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission has just directed MakeMyTrip to reimburse a couple for a travel package and provide compensation due to a trip cancellation caused by a denied VISA application. Published by Voxya as an initiative to help consumers in resolving consumer complaints.", "author": "user_38105", "created": "2024-06-15 11:12:48+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1dgfmyi/visa_rejections_have_led_makemytrip_to_offer/", "keywords": "202.9,30,33,36.6,41,5,84,000,add-on,address,aeronautics", "images": []}

We want to hike for the first half of the trip and spend the second half relaxing and doing fun activities on some nice sandy beaches. We are not interested in nightlife at all and prefer to stay in places without overwhelming tourist presence. If possible, it would be best to not have to rent a car but we are open to it if it makes sense.

I was going to Pittsburgh to see family and friends over the Memorial Day weekend with my boyfriend and because I was staying a little longer than usual, wanted a deal. This does not mean I was prepared to sacrifice comfort, I just wanted to see how much bang I could get for my buck. This review isn't a slam so much as it is a cautionary tale to remind people to walk into an experience knowing who you are.. I went to Verbo hadn't tried it before, couldn't recall any thing negative about them and started researching what was available. Happened upon several units in what appears to be the same building going for a very reasonable rate. Good view, centrally located, free off-street parking, pics looked nice and clean, reviews positive. Booked one. First things first. If they say free parking , make sure you get details before booking. The unit DID come with free parking. However, it was only one 1 free parking space. My boyfriend and I were coming from different places so we had to find alternative parking for one vehicle or pay 30 USD a night and no in and out privileges. The unit was cute. When I finally found it. The building did not consistently number the rooms, so I ended up wandering the halls looking for the unit. Once I was in yeah , I immediately set to unpacking. That's when I notice 1 closet with miss matched hangers including some wire hangers - didn't Joan Crawford ban that shit, like, FOREVER and NO chest of drawers. The closet wasn't a bad size for a 3-day trip for 2 adults, but the only drawers in the bedroom were the single drawers in the very petite side tables beside the bed. Ok, we can make do. I then go into the loo to put away my toiletries. Bathroom is a good size but the sink is small. But there are drawers under the sink so I put most of my toiletries there. I go to put my scrub cloth and shower things into the shower and realize the jacuzzi-like tub is about 2 inches higher than my knee. I am going to need a pole vault to get in there. THAT'S when I notice there is no ventilation fan in the loo. That is going to make this long weekend VERY interesting, indeed. The theme for the unit was, Sike . The unit had a full size kitchen yeah but had 3 forks, 5 knives 2 teaspoons and 3 soup spoons. It had dishwasher tabs but no dishwashing liquid. It had a Keurig but no pods. It had a weird assortment of spices but no salt or pepper. The host was personable, but not particularly helpful. We had an issue with the TV no slow internet and when we alerted them they asked if we could unplug and reposition the router. But there was no router. Looked high and low for it. And when we told them, they said they would have to get the cleaner to confirm, which did ZIP concerning our immediate problem - no TV. We then realized they were using some sort of mesh system, the internet was just REALLY slow. But they didn't know this All in all, not an experience I want to have again. But if this is the worst mini-holiday getaway I ever have, I will count myself lucky.", "author": "user_78478", "created": "2024-05-26 15:37:26+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1d140qe/verbo_expectations_vs_experience/", "keywords": ",,-,.,1,2,3,3-day,30,5,5'5,", "images": []}

{"id": "1cq68jq", "title": "Aruba vacation -Barcelo Resort. May 2024", "body": "Before traveling to Aruba I searched for days to find good reviews on places to stay and eating, I was also budgeting. Only looking to be at about 3k-3500 with airfare and hotel for 2 people 3 nights 4 days. I hate traveling and not being able to eat good food. We decided the last minute to stay at an All inclusive resort. First for the resort The resort is listed as a 5 star. However it fell a little short of a 5 star to me. It s more of a 4 star. But it s not bad at all. We decided to get a Royal room which gives you few added perks. Like premium drinks. A special restaurant for just Royal level guests only. We only ate lunch at restaurant once. It was decent. Nothing to wow us. However other guest swear by the Breakfast and dinner there. The grounds are Nice and the beach is beautiful. The pool is great and hot tubs are steaming. You are right at beach from here. Sidenote on pool. There is limited pool seating. Many guest get up at 5 30am to get spots by pool And leave towels. I saw this on many reviews so I was prepared. I went down at 6 15am to get us 2 chairs for the day. By 7am all chairs were taken. However around noon to 1pm a couple spots will open up. After 5 there is plenty of chairs and pool is open until 8. The beach are for Royal level was very easy to get chairs and you have your own premium bar for Royal level at the beach. Bartender was amazing and made us strong drinks. Lobby bar night time crew was amazing. The also have premium liquor for everybody. The majority of staff are very friendly and helpful. The crowd is slightly older. Location is great a lot to walk to off the resort. Other foods, shopping and etc. As far as food goes Breakfast buffet at one of the restaurants was solid. Great omelets We also had breakfast one day across the street because my wife only eats turkey bacon. Salt n pepper was the name of restaurant and it was Amazing Great food and not expensive. Literally right across the street from resort. For lunch buffet at beach restaurant there wasn t a lot of variety. However I had a cheeseburger that was really good. Came on a nice bun, I added some bacon and it hit the spot. Dinner on resort First night we had Aruban Seafood. It was just ok. But not hateful. We had Italian one night which was good. We had Mexican another night which was also really good. They had fajitas my favorite Mexican dish flavored very good. My wife had the Mahi mahi and she said it was really good, We also ate at 3 other restaurants off the resort. 1 dinner at Bogart s which was about a 7 min walk to like the downtown area of Palm Beach. The restaurant was beautiful. I had a great Ceasar salad, I ordered the filet mignon and it was one of the better filets I have had, I m normally a NY strip kinda guy. My wife had fish but wasn t impressed by the flavor. We also ate at Papia Mia for lunch. Just getting pizza and little bites. Food was really good. Again the restaurant was walking distance from hotel. Only 2-3 mins. Another lunch meal in same area was at Fishes and more. All food was really good here. Wife had the blackened Mahi. I had an early bird special. Ceasar salad, chicken Alfredo and came with a small ice cream Sunday for 27.50. For it what is worth. The all inclusive at Barcelo was decent however I definitely enjoyed the food off the resort better. We stopped in Hyatt next door and there grounds are Insane Would love to stay there next time.

She had a whole itinerary planned before coming with some of the top rated destinations and things to do. One of which included the Road to Hana. We didn t have much money to spend on booking a tour, so we drove it ourselves and split it into two days. I have the vehicle rental in my name and have spent a majority of my time driving around. The road wasn t stressful at all for me, but I didn t want to feel like a nuisance to locals. When we came to a stop that didn t really look like a stop I kinda just said we should skip it. This happened frequently and I think it began upsetting my wife when I started skipping things. On top of that, my wife had written the itinerary by selecting places that were geographically close in distance. However, when routing it while here, we realized that s not how that works something 10 miles away could require a 3 hour drive because you have to go up and around. This was 100 a planning mistake, but again, now we re are crossing more off of our list without visiting. We spent 1 2 a day in a target parking lot rewriting our whole schedule. We decided to head to some beaches yesterday and personally, that felt like the most vacation I have had. I was able to get out of the car and just relax. No issue with that right Well the wind picked up an hour or so after we had arrived. The waves picked up and sand was blasting us while we sat on the beach. We ended up leaving and just going to a few shops. I guess I just don t know how to turn things around at this point. We are doing things a bit more local so I won t be upset driving all day.

{"id": "1blwyaf", "title": "Great Wolf Lodge in NC for 5 adults, 3 kids", "body": "Just got back from a 4 night trip to the GWL in Concord, NC with our kids and grandkids our ages 65, 61, 41, 40, 38, 13, 10, 9 . We had a great family trip - some small issues but easily handled. Thoughts and handy notes Bring a pair of scissors to trim the wristbands. Bring a Sharpie marker to put names on passes, cups, etc. Bring towels or beach wraps to get from the pool area back to your rooms since you have to leave the provided pool towels in the pool area or you'll get charged. We brought our own paper towels, plates and bowls as well as plasticware which made eating in our room a much better experience. Wheelchair users - our grandchild found the carpeting to be a bit tough to maneuver on so we ended up pushing them around quite a bit. Sometimes it is faster and easier to walk outside and enter thru the main lobby than wind your way thru the hallways. The refillable cups were easy to refill in the pool area. Just scan the cup and fill. The check in process was long but I believe it was needed for everything to be explained - leave the kids in the car with an adult for this step The luggage carts are not like what you'd see at a hotel, more like the trolleys you'd see in an airport. They don't hold as much as one night think. They are plentiful, though Our suite was on the 4th floor and ceilings were high, giving it a really spacious feel. We had the Grizzly Bear Den which is a two bedroom two bath suite which slept 8 easily. One king bed room with private bath, two queen beds room and a full size pull out sofabed in the living room. Second bathroom was by the main door to the suite with a separate sink area. Mini fridge, microwave, small coffee maker are in a hall between the bedrooms with a sink area. Dish soap was provided. Not quite enough seating in the living room for all 8 of us so we brought in the two chairs from the balcony. No full size dining table in the suite, just a low coffee table in front of the sofa and a small round table in the corner suitable for two people . Wish we had known this would have brought a folding table. We did rent poolside cabanas for the three full days of our stay. I have to say it was well worth the price to have a home base for us to leave everything while we did the rides, mini golf, etc. And no need to scramble to get there early to reserve enough tables and chairs in an area large enough for the 8 of us one wheelchair . There was a mini fridge came with 4 bottled waters each day with a lockable safe compartment, five towels to use for the day plus a TV, power outlets and a ceiling fan. Seating included two chaise lounges, 2 chairs, small 3 piece sectional type couch, one small coffee table, one regular height dining table again, suitable for 2 and a small round table next to one of the chaises. There is a QR code in order to request cabana service they also came around every 15-30 minutes and they were all very friendly and accommodating. The Great Wolf Lodge app had some glitches and errors. It had the wrong amenities listed for our Food Fun package but the staff at the lodge generously permitted usage based on what our app listed. One nice feature was being able to chat - a way to ask questions and get answers without having to make any calls. We used it about 4 or 5 times when we ran into issues. The fire alarm went off on our first morning and we followed instructions and went outside. Once there, we could no longer hear what was being said and no employees were outside to explain to us what to do next. We saw the fire truck arrive and waited a bit. People started drifting back inside it was only 34 degrees out and most people had no coats with them after about 30 minutes. Speakers outside or employees to instruct us would have been appreciated. That afternoon, we had no hot water at all. Cold showers for everyone and we microwaved the water necessary for the medical treatment that one in our family needed. Asked when to expect hot water in the app chat after dinner , and someone came to our door to explain that there had been a problem that morning and it was now repaired. They tested the water temp and advised us to let the taps run for a bit. Hot showers all around that night The breakfast and dinner buffets at the Loose Moose were well worth it, given the age spread and diverse eating preferences. Auto gratuity of 18 added for groups over 6 and I happily added an additional tip to both the breakfast and dinner wait staff They all were amazing and well trained. Breakfast buffet included an omelet station as well as both turkey sausage and pork sausage, bacon, French toast sticks, pancakes, fruit, grits, pastries and more. Dinner buffet included salad bar, plentiful desserts, shrimp, catfish, pork loin, roast chicken, chicken nuggets, fries, mashed potatoes, gravy, cornbread, etc. Picked up breakfast at Dunkin inside the lodge 3 mornings and it was easy to do in the app and ready when stated it would be. Lunch in the cabana was good - kids liked the pizza from Buckets. Salads were fresh, wings were tasty. Burgers were flavorful and freshly made Brought our own snacks including cucumbers, cheese, yogurt, crackers, fruit, etc. One dinner we treated our group to the sit down restaurant Lodge Wood Fired Grill within the lodge with a reservation at 5 15. It was less than enjoyable. Arrived on time. Seated late. Served late. Wait staff was less than stellar. Several food items did not arrive and since we were charged for them so I had to wait for waiter to notice and return to table to have those items taken off the bill. Also, table not cleared until after desserts were brought over. Two shareable desserts just plopped down with no plates, utensils, or comments. I went over to bartender to ask about plates etc and they sent someone over to clear table and provide plates and forks. Desserts were room temp at that point one was a hot apple cobbler and one was a hot brownie sundae . Auto gratuity of 18 added for bills over 6 people, which was more than I would have given her based on the lack of attention to our table. The place was not filled nor was the wait staff overworked. Perhaps undertrained or unwilling A disappointment either way. Note The following night we ordered a similar meal at the local Texas Roadhouse and the bill was half that as at the lodge and wait staff there were on the ball. About Magi Quest and Shadow Quest - the three grandkids loved it We got them each the Wolf Pass so they each got a wand and the games along with other things like a Build A Bear, mining experience, mini golf, ice cream, candy etc . They had a BLAST running around the lodge with their wands ages 9, 10 and 14 . TL DR Yep, it was fun and we had a great time..... And we'll go visit other locations, especially the Naples, Florida new location once they open this fall edited to add cross posted", "author": "user_40959", "created": "2024-03-23 16:56:59+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1blwyaf/great_wolf_lodge_in_nc_for_5_adults_3_kids/", "keywords": ",,-,.,10,10,,13,,14,15-30,15.,18", "images": []}

This is in direct opposition to what I was told when I bought the package. I was also told that there are no hidden fees, and the taxes you pay average 5-10 per night. The reservation I inquired about, not my first choice or even close because all those were seemingly booked, was over 100 per night extra in taxes.

I've never taken a trip anywhere for my birthday because of how crazy it is between Christmas and New Years. But this year I will be turning 28, and my dream for the last several years has been to take an awesome trip for my golden birthday golden birthdays were a big deal in my family growing up and l've waited FOREVER for mine, haha . My original plan was to visit NYC to experience the Christmas festivities, but I also realize that's about as busy as travel can get if I do that. So it's an option I'm keeping in mind, but I wanted to hear if anyone had some good suggestions for some amazing places to be at that time of year If you ve had an awesome late December experience somewhere, I d love to hear it. I don t drink alcohol, I m not much of a party type, and I think museums are okay but not something I seek out. I do love touristy things, good food, and beautiful scenery. Depending on the destination, I m okay with either spending Christmas Day in said location, or just flying out there like the day after. Dates can be flexible. I'm not opposed to traveling out of the country, I just have two toddlers to consider whether taking them with or leaving them with family . I live in Utah, I am open to big cities or nature adventures or anything in between, and I don't have a preference for warm or cold climates. I m fine with visiting a state place I ve been before, so nowhere is really off-limits Since this might be my only birthday trip ever or for a long time at least I'm okay with spending more money to make it happen, though I'm definitely not ultra rich haha. So all that being said, any ideas Thanks everyone", "author": "user_50762", "created": "2024-03-14 19:34:02+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1bettgg/december_birthday_trip_suggestions/", "keywords": ".,28,,28th,,adventures,after.,alcohol,,amazing,anyone,anything,anywhere", "images": []}

K stutis second wife Birute was dissatisfied with an old Trakai castle because it had too little water around it. She longed to hear gentle waves of the sea because she was from Planga, a sea town in Lithuania, that is why lake island was chosen as the place for a new castle The Trakai castle was almost completely destroyed but rebuilt in the 1950s-1960s by Lithuanian initiative despite many of resistance from Soviet authorities at the time.

{"id": "107qwz7", "title": "Tell me where to go", "body": "UPDATE I picked Virginia Beach for the following reasons Short 2 hour flight Beaches and warm Airbnb opportunities with a pool Lots of walkable fun The boardwalk The aquarium Drivable to Coloniel Williamsburg and the Outer Banks Not overly priced more moderate for things. Cheap flights car rentals. Giving myself a 6,000 budget for 3 people, which I think should be more than enough after pricing out flights, airbnb, admissions to different activities, car rental, gas, groceries, and eating out. Original post I am looking for vacation destination ideas. I will list out some must-haves, would likes, and things that are hard no's. Specific relevant details are that it will be me 38f and two 12f that will be going. I am celebrating finishing school and want to take a quasi-mother-daughter trip where she can invite her bff to help balance too much mom time lol. I have only ever been on a plane once, and she has not yet been so nothing international. Looking for dates in June. She is out of school June 5th so anytime after that for around 5 nights. We would be flying out of Chicago. I don't have an exact budget, but not luxury that is for sure. I am middle class and a moderate spender. I am willing to spend enough for a great experience but not frivolously. Places I have considered Kauai Hawaii - I REALLY want to go here, but traveling that far with 2 12y olds with long travel days is too impractical. Puerto Rico - My daughter is half PR and we have talked about how she wants to visit multiple times, but she inherits her PR side from her dad, so if she goes with anyone I feel it's only right she goes with him so she can meet family, etc. SoCal LA San Diego - I think she would have a lot of fun here, but I am super worried about the traffic. I considered a road trip down the PCH but I feel like the only way to not overwhelm and stress us out is to allow 10 days, which is not cheap when thinking of staying, eating, and gas in CA. Thought maybe just San Diego but then I know she will want to visit LA but again, with traffic and general cost, I don't want to spend the whole trip driving back and forth between places. Outer Banks - This seemed like a good idea in that she loves that show and I know it will feel cool to visit there, but the rates on the beach are like 400-500 a night in June, also read in a forum the traffic can be bad that time of year. If anyone has any further intel on this area I am still open to it, things to do, cost savings, beaches Myrtle Beach - Again seems like a good idea, I have just never been. Is it fun for pre-teens Better places to stay or things there are to do for 5 days worth of vacay Monterey Bay San Fran - Again, an area I would really like to visit. Are there beaches good for swimming at all Is the traffic super bad in Northern California Must Haves Pool and or Beach - these girls are half fish they are going to want to swim. Doesn't have to be ocean side if there are other water opportunities like lakes and such Safe area - I want my girls to be able to walk around the property or go to the pool without constant direct supervision. Away from Chicago - we live close enough here that we have done all the things and want to experience something new. Flights 6 hours or less from the Chicago area, again don't want super long travel days. Warm - Canada Alaska areas are still too cold this time of year for us. Would Likes Not too far from the airport - like within 2 hours of the airport we would fly into, again don't want to spend the whole time just traveling. Activities and Relaxing - want some chill days and some days where we can go somewhere and actually do something fun. Open to accommodation type. AirBnB with a kitchen would be nice and cost-effective but I am okay with a hotel if it gets us closer to the attractions. Hard No Camping - travelling to camp somewhere is not efficient and we are not strong enough campers to pull off that many days. Super remote locations - again, we want some fun and interaction. We would like to hike one day but don't want to spend the whole time in the mountains. New York City - No desire to go here, too many people, too much traffic, too overwhelming to do unless familiar with the city. x200B So, any suggestions or more information on any area above", "author": "unknown", "created": "2023-01-09 21:39:35+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/107qwz7/tell_me_where_to_go/", "keywords": "-,10,12f,12y,2,3,38f,400-500,5,5th", "images": []}

She booked her flight straight away and sent me a message saying, get yours now - I can't be in Copenhagen on my own So, foolishly I went along with it but I have now decided I really really don't want to go for a number of reasons. 1. I don't want to have to travel to London, I would much rather go from an airport near me as it would be a lot more convenient 2. My sister who I haven't seen in months will be visiting the weekend we're meant to fly, and I would rather see her 3. I can't actually afford it, I am currently back living with parents and I desperately want to move out, if I spend the money I have saved on a holiday, it will mean having to stay here longer 4. I don't think I will enjoy it, I'm not close enough with her to speak my mind, in fact I find her insufferably spoilt sometimes, but I feel bad because she likes me and she doesn't really have many true close friends, I think she will tell me what to do and I will find it incredibly irritating as I highly value my independence, I would happily go on my own and meet up with her from time to time, but I don't want to go with her as I find the other friends she will be seeing there stuck up and insufferable too. What do I do I felt very on the spot and didn't really consider it all properly, I feel bad letting her down but I just don't want to go anymore, I feel bad that she has to be in Copenhagen for 19hours when she doesn't want to be alone but she's 24, I'm 22 and would feel fine spending the day there - maybe it would be good character building for her lol.

{"id": "1375td4", "title": "I really don't like planning stuff, and honestly, I just want to go on vacation before my wife does.", "body": "It's been three years since we last had a proper vacation due to our house burning down. We've managed to save up to 3,500 in a vacation fund. While I want to go in July or August, my wife prefers to wait and take a cruise early next year. She's open to going sooner, but only if we plan everything out like a cruise itinerary, including meals. I'm not sure what the best approach is - should we plan everything out or wait six to eight months for the cruise Also, my wife is into seeing shows every night, whereas I'm more interested in having a good time and partying a bit. We're both willing to compromise, but I'm struggling to plan this trip. I think it's because we never had to worry about rent or mortgage payments before. After my dad passed away, we inherited his home, but it burned down, and we had to use what little we had to get an apartment, new clothes, and home essentials. We were fortunate enough to go on two vacations a year for the first three years of our marriage, but after saving for three years on a tight budget, I'm feeling down that we still can't make it happen. The problem with a cruise is that my wife is envisioning it being like our honeymoon cruise with a balcony, a spa package, five planned excursions, and a drink package. But even if we wait and book in advance, we can't afford that kind of luxury anymore. While a bigger vacation would feel better, we just don't have the funds to make it happen. We've both been working 50 to 70 hours a week to keep up with the extra 1,750 per month in bills since the fire. I feel like a vacation is long overdue, but my wife is set on having a structured experience like a cruise, and I'm just too exhausted to plan every single detail. Any advice PS As this is Reddit, I feel obliged to mention that we are still putting money aside for an emergency fund, investments, 401ks, home fund, and emergency medical fund. So, it's not like we're squandering the 3,500 - it's exactly what we saved up for.", "author": "unknown", "created": "2023-05-04 01:26:05+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/1375td4/i_really_dont_like_planning_stuff_and_honestly_i/", "keywords": "-,1,750,3,500,401ks,,50,70,advance,,advice,afford,also,", "images": []}

I want it to be more of an activities adventurous sightseeing holiday rather than sunbathing, as we're vacationing with his family in Tenerife in September, and we'll be doing plenty of that then I've asked around and the options below seem to be the most popular choices. I'm not leaning any particular way for any of them, they each have their own appeal. Rome is very beautiful and romantic and won't be really hot at that time of year. My boyfriend has always really wanted to go to Amsterdam and I've heard it's got some amazing cultural stuff to see like Anne Frank House and the Van Gogh Museum. Apparently Barcelona is also really good for sightseeing, has nice beaches and wouldn't be too warm for us either. Hoping to book soon so some help would be appreciated.

{"id": "puq616", "title": "Avoid US Virgin Islands St. Thomas", "body": "My girlfriend and I just spent the last 5 days in the U.S. Virgin Islands, St. Thomas. If I could rate this vacation in stars it would be 2 5. The thing that skews this negative was the locals. I got the impression that I wasn t welcomed anywhere except the extremely tourist geared attractions. As we tried to explore the island we met local after local who we would say hello to walking down the limited streets suited for pedestrian travel, literally 1 10 said hello back. We used the car ferry from St. Thomas to St. John and was verbally abused, scoffed at and generally treated like scum by the employees who run the dock ferry. Public officials don t look you in the eye a cop literally ignored a question for directions before pulling away and at points you get this vibe that anyone who lives there hates you. The roads are deplorable, the architecture outside of the resorts tourist driven amenities give you the flavor of being in an underdeveloped third world country despite over a 1.5 billion in aid and grants since 2018 and anywhere you need to go will involve 10ft wide streets littered with hairpin turns, safari taxis swerving onto your side and people from the mainland still wrapping their head around driving a left hand drive car on the left side of the road still don t know why they haven t changed that law Don t drive here if you have road anxiety, you will not last luckily, I do not . Trying to reach out of elected officials was a bust, totally ignored my email regarding concerns about their ferry services and the aggressive sometimes threatening employees. As a stark example of what I mean, check out the VI Travel FaceBook group and experience locals telling tourists not to come so we don t use up all our resources. Yes, the resources that US tax payer dollars goes to pay for. There were good experiences Meagan s Bay, Hiking on St John, an ecotour kayak through the reef and protected islands plus the highly recommended restaurants like Prime, Caribbean Seafood Market and Sunset Grill but everything named above exists to appease tourism so they are as expected very kind and welcoming. In conclusion, unless you plan on booking and staying at a resort the entire time, I would avoid St. Thomas 100 . It was, on the main, a huge disappointment for the money I spent. Good Luck finding your perfect vacation spot TL DR Locals are insular and cold to tourists, infrastructure is bad and unless you stay at a resort, avoid St. Thomas for vacation.", "author": "user_34741", "created": "2021-09-24 18:54:50+00:00", "url": "https://www.reddit.com/r/Vacations/comments/puq616/avoid_us_virgin_islands_st_thomas/", "keywords": ".,1,1.5,10,100,10ft,2,2018,5,5.", "images": []}
